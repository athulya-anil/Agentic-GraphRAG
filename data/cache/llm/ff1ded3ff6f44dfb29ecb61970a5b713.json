{"response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from experience [1]. More specifically, it allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed [2]. This means that machine learning enables systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, by learning from data and improving over time [2]. \n\nIn summary, machine learning is a technology that enables systems to learn and improve from experience, and it is a key component of the broader field of artificial intelligence [1, 2]."}
