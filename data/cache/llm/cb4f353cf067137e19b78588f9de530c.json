{"response": "{\"faithfulness\": 0.85, \"reasoning\": \"Most claims are supported by the context, such as machine learning being a subset of artificial intelligence and enabling systems to learn from experience. However, the statement that machine learning enables systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence is more directly related to the definition of artificial intelligence itself, rather than machine learning specifically, which slightly reduces faithfulness.\"}"}
