Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data [1, 3]. The key aspect of blockchain is that it is resistant to modification of its data, as once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks [1]. This suggests that blockchain works by creating a chain of blocks, where each block is linked to the previous one through a cryptographic hash, making it difficult to modify the data once it's recorded.\n\nHowever, the context does not provide a detailed explanation of how blockchain works, such as how new blocks are added, how consensus is achieved, or how the network is maintained.
