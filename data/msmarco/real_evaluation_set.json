The same property that keeps the storm going also produces most tornadoes. The wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel. The air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air (and possibly objects) into it. Tornadoes can form any time during the year, but most form in May. But, more severe ones form earlier because the most damge is caused in April. The more north you go, the later the peak tornado season is. This is because it takes longer to warm the northern parts of the plains so tornadoes form later.",

Next, count the number of places that the decimal point must be moved to get back to the original number, which in this case is 5 places. This number will be the exponent on the power of 10. So 642,000 can be written in scientific notation as 6.42 x 10^5. Note that the exponent is positive, because the original number is a whole number.

As a precaution, it is usually responsible to say that the majority of opiates will leave the body, within at least 5 to 7 days! How Long Do Opiates Stay In Your Urine It should be known that the amount of time that opiates will remain in your urine is different from the information provided above. When it comes to urine, the drugs will usually dissipate much more rapidly.

In the United States, anemia is diagnosed if a blood test finds less than 13.5 g/dL in a man or less than 12 g/dL in a woman. In children, normal levels vary according to age. What do high hemoglobin levels mean? High hemoglobin levels could be indicative of the rare blood disease, polycythemia.

In a study of 700 elderly women, those with vitamin B-12 deficiencies were twice as likely as others to be severely depressed. Our most important finding was that vitamin B-12 deficiency and depression are correlated. This is the first proof of this association, says researcher Brenda W.J.H. Penninx, PhD.",
